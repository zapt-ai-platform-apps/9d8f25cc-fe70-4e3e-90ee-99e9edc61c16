# Use Calculator

This journey explains how to use the built-in calculator to perform mathematical calculations within the app.

## Steps

1. **Access the Calculator**
   - On the home page, locate the "Calculator" section.
   - The calculator is prominently displayed for easy access.

2. **Enter a Mathematical Expression**
   - Click on the input field labeled "Enter math expression".
   - Type in your desired mathematical expression, such as `2 + 2` or `sqrt(16)`.

3. **Perform the Calculation**
   - After entering the expression, click the "Calculate" button.
   - The app will process your input and display the result below.

4. **View the Result**
   - The result of your calculation appears under the "Result" label.
   - For example, entering `2 + 2` will display `Result: 4`.

5. **Handle Errors**
   - If an invalid expression is entered, the result will show "Error".
   - Ensure that your mathematical expressions are correctly formatted.

6. **Perform Additional Calculations**
   - Clear the input field by manually deleting the existing text.
   - Enter a new mathematical expression and repeat the calculation steps.

## Example

- **Input**: `5 * 3`
- **Action**: Click "Calculate"
- **Result**: `Result: 15`

- **Input**: `10 / 0`
- **Action**: Click "Calculate"
- **Result**: `Result: Error`

## Important Information
- **Expression Evaluation**: The calculator uses JavaScript's `eval` function to evaluate expressions. Ensure that inputs are safe and intended.
- **Supported Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), parentheses, and mathematical functions like `sqrt()` are supported.

## Warnings
- **Security**: Using `eval` can be risky. Only perform calculations with trusted inputs.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator currently only displays "Error" for invalid expressions. More detailed error messages may be implemented in future updates.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly perform a variety of mathematical calculations within the app's calculator feature.
