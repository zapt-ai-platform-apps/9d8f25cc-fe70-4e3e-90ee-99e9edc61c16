# Manage Content

This journey guides you through managing various content types within the app, including hiding or showing Apps, Files, Photos, and Music.

## Steps

1. **Navigate to Manage Content Section**
   - After signing in, locate the "Manage Content" section on the home page.
   - This section is typically found towards the bottom of the main content area.

2. **Toggle Visibility of Content Types**
   - You will see buttons labeled "Hide Apps", "Hide Files", "Hide Photos", and "Hide Music".
   - Each button corresponds to a specific content type.

3. **Hide a Content Type**
   - Click on the "Hide Apps" button to hide the Apps content.
   - The button label will change to "Show Apps", indicating the current state is hidden.
   - The Apps content area will be concealed from view.

4. **Show a Content Type**
   - If a content type is hidden, the corresponding button will display "Show [Content Type]".
   - Click the "Show Apps" button to make the Apps content visible again.
   - The Apps content area will reappear on the screen.

5. **Repeat for Other Content Types**
   - Use the "Hide Files", "Hide Photos", and "Hide Music" buttons to manage visibility of Files, Photos, and Music sections respectively.
   
6. **Confirm Changes**
   - Ensure that the content areas are shown or hidden based on your interactions.
   - The state is maintained in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

7. **Sign Out and Sign In (Optional)**
   - Changes made to content visibility are session-based.
   - Signing out and signing back in will reset visibility settings to default.

## Important Information
- **Responsive Design**: The Manage Content section is responsive and works seamlessly across all device sizes.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Visibility changes are immediate, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Persistent State**: Currently, visibility settings are not persisted across sessions. Future updates may include state persistence.

## Warnings
- **Multiple Toggles**: Rapidly clicking hide/show buttons may lead to unexpected UI behavior. It is recommended to allow operations to complete before initiating new ones.
- **Content Management**: Hiding content does not delete it. It merely conceals it from the current view.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage the visibility of different content types within the app, tailoring the interface to your preferences.
